### BASIC DATA TYPES

#### NUMERIC
+ default computational data type, representing decimals  

```r
> x = 10.5       # assign a decimal value
> x              # print the value of x
[1] 10.5
> class(x)       # print the class name of x
[1] "numeric"
> k = 1          # assigning integer to k, k still stored as numeric
> k              # print the value of k
[1] 1
> class(k)       # print the class name of k
[1] "numeric"
```

#### integers
+ `as.integer` function used to assign integers

```r
> y = as.integer(3)
> y              # print the value of y
[1] 3
> class(y)       # print the class name of y
[1] "integer"
> is.integer(y)  # is y an integer?
[1] TRUE
```

+ coersion of numeric to integers
```r
> as.integer(3.14)    # coerce a numeric value
[1] 3
```

+ __TRUE__ has value of 1 and __FALSE__ has value of 0
```r
> as.integer(TRUE)    # the numeric value of TRUE
[1] 1
> as.integer(FALSE)   # the numeric value of FALSE
[1] 0
```

#### complex
+ defined via pure imaginary values `i`
```r
> z = 1 + 2i     # create a complex number
> z              # print the value of z
[1] 1+2i
> class(z)       # print the class name of z
[1] "complex"
```

#### logical
+ often created when comparing variables
```r
> x = 1; y = 2   # sample values
> z = x > y      # is x larger than y?
> z              # print the logical value
[1] FALSE
> class(z)       # print the class name of z
[1] "logical"
```

+ Standard logical operations are "&" (and), "|" (or), and "!" (negation).
```r
> u = TRUE; v = FALSE
> u & v          # u AND v
[1] FALSE
> u | v          # u OR v
[1] TRUE
> !u             # negation of u
[1] FALSE
```

#### character
+ used to represent strings in R
```r
> x = as.character(3.14)
> x              # print the character string
[1] "3.14"
> class(x)       # print the class name of x
[1] "character"
```
+ `paste` concatenates character values
```r
> fname = "Joe"; lname ="Smith"
> paste(fname, lname)
[1] "Joe Smith"
```

+ `sprintf` is convenient to create readable strings
```r
> sprintf("%s has %d dollars", "Sam", 100)
[1] "Sam has 100 dollars"
```

+ `substr` extract substring  
```r
> substr("Mary has a little lamb.", start=3, stop=12)
[1] "ry has a l"
```

+ `sub` removes first occurrence with another string
```r
> sub("little", "big", "Mary has a little lamb.")
[1] "Mary has a big lamb."
```

### Vectors
+ a sequence of data elements of the same basic types, members are called _components_  

```r
> c(2, 3, 5)        # a vector containing 3 numeric values
[1] 2 3 5   
> c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)    # a vector of logical values
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE

> length(c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee"))     # length of vector given by length()
[1] 5
```

#### Combining vectors
+ vectors can be combined using the `c()` function


```r
> n = c(2, 3, 5)
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")
> c(n, s)                                     # 2 vectors combined to 1 vector
[1] "2"  "3"  "5"  "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"   # numeric values are coerced to character
                                              # to maintain the same primitive data type

```

#### Vector arithmetics  


```r
> a = c(1, 3, 5, 7)
> b = c(1, 2, 4, 8)
> 5 * a               # a vector with each of its member multiplied by 5
[1]  5 15 25 35
> a + b               # sum is a vector whose members are the sum of corresponding elemtns from a and b
[1]  2  5  9 15
> a - b
[1]  0  1  1 -1
> a * b
[1]  1  6 20 56
```
+ recycling rules: when two vectors are of unequal length. The shorter vector will be recycled to match the longer vector


```r
> u = c(10, 20, 30)
> v = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
> u + v
[1] 11 22 33 14 25 36 17 28 39
```

#### Vector index
+ Retrival of value from vector by declaring an index inside a single _squre bracket_ `[]`

```r
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")
> s[3]
[1] "cc"
```

+ If the index is negative, it would strip the member whose position has the same absolute value as the negative index.    

```r
> s[-3]
[1] "aa" "bb" "dd" "ee"
```

+ If an index is out-of-range, a missing value will be reported via the symbol NA.
```r
> s[10]
[1] NA
```

#### Numeric index vector
+ A new vector can be sliced from a given vector with a __numeric index vector__, which consists of member positions of the original vector to be retrieved.    

```r
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")
> s[c(2, 3)]
[1] "bb" "cc"

> s[c(2, 3, 3)]           # duplicate index
[1] "bb" "cc" "cc"

> s[c(2, 1, 3)]           # out of order indexes
[1] "bb" "aa" "cc"

> s[2:4]                  # range index
[1] "bb" "cc" "dd"
```

#### Logical Index vector    
+ A new vector can be sliced from a given vector with a logical index vector, which has the same length as the original vector. Its members are TRUE if the corresponding members in the original vector are to be included in the slice, and FALSE if otherwise.    

```r
> s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee")
> L = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)          # retrieve 2nd and 4th member of s
> s[L]
[1] "bb" "dd"

> s[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]           # abbreviated to a single line
[1] "bb" "dd"
```

#### Named Vector member
+ we can assign names to vector members  

```r
> v = c("Mary", "Sue")                # a character string vector with 2 members
> v
[1] "Mary" "Sue"

> names(v) = c("First", "Last")       # name members
> v
 First   Last
"Mary"  "Sue"

> v["First"]                          # retrieve by name
[1] "Mary"

> v[c("Last", "First")]               #  reverse the order with a character string index vector
  Last  First
 "Sue" "Mary"
```

### Matrix     
+ A matrix is a collection of data elements arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout. The data elements must be of the same basic type.   

```r
> A = matrix(
+   c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # the data elements
+   nrow=2,              # number of rows
+   ncol=3,              # number of columns
+   byrow = TRUE)        # fill matrix by rows

> A                      # print the matrix
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    2    4    3
[2,]    1    5    7


> A[2, 3]                # access element at 2nd row, 3rd column
[1] 7

> A[2, ]                 # access the 2nd row
[1] 1 5 7

> A[ ,3]                 # access the 3rd column
[1] 3 7

> A[ ,c(1,3)]           # extract more than one column/row => the 1st and 3rd columns
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    3
[2,]    1    7

> dimnames(A) = list(                # assign names to the rows and columns of the matrix
+   c("row1", "row2"),               # row names
+   c("col1", "col2", "col3"))       # column names

> A                
     col1 col2 col3
row1    2    4    3
row2    1    5    7

> A["row2", "col3"]                  # access elements by name
[1] 7         
```

### Matrix construction
+ When we construct a matrix directly with data elements, the matrix content is filled along the column orientation by default.

```r
> B = matrix(
+   c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7),
+   nrow=3,
+   ncol=2)

> B             # B has 3 rows and 2 columns
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    1
[2,]    4    5
[3,]    3    7
```

+ We construct the __transpose__ of a matrix by interchanging its columns and rows with the function t .

```r
> t(B)          # transpose of B
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    2    4    3
[2,]    1    5    7
```

+ The columns of two matrices having the same number of rows can be __combined__ into a larger matrix. For example, suppose we have another matrix C also with 3 rows.

```r
> C = matrix(
+   c(7, 4, 2),
+   nrow=3,
+   ncol=1)

> C             # C has 3 rows
     [,1]
[1,]    7
[2,]    4
[3,]    2

> cbind(B, C)         # combine columns of B and C with cbind (if they have same number of rows)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    2    1    7
[2,]    4    5    4
[3,]    3    7    2

> D = matrix(
+   c(6, 2),
+   nrow=1,
+   ncol=2)

> D             # D has 2 columns
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    6    2

> rbind(B, D)       # combine rows of D and D with rbind  (if they have same number of columns)
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    1
[2,]    4    5
[3,]    3    7
[4,]    6    2
```

+ __destruct__ a matrix by applying the c function, which combines all column vectors into one

```r
> c(B)
[1] 2 4 3 1 5 7
```
