[__strsplit__](http://rfunction.com/archives/1499)
Split a character string or vector of character strings using a regular expression or a literal (fixed) string. The strsplit function outputs a list, where each list item corresponds to an element of x that has been split. In the simplest case, x is a single character string, and strsplit outputs a one-item list.

`strsplit(x, split, fixed=FALSE)`


[__trimws__](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/trimws.html)  
Remove leading and/or trailing whitespace from character strings.

`trimws(x, which = c("both", "left", "right"))`
