[_ANOVA explained_](https://www.edanzediting.com/blogs/statistics-anova-explained)  

F-value is calculated from which p-value can be derived.

+ Null hypothesis: all population means are equal
+ Alternative hypothesis: at least one population mean is different from the rest.

_calculate F ratio_

+ calculate between group variation: compare mean of each group with overall mean of data  
+ calculate variation within group: variation of each observation from group mean
+ f ratio = mean between group variation / mean within group variation
  + larger f ratio = smaller p value
