TO-DOs

- [X] survival graph with respect to CACNG4 in sequenced breast cancer cohorts
	+ However, result not significant
- [ ] explore the TCGA as well as the METABRIC dataset
- [ ] explore correlation of CACNG4 with tumor phenotype, in particular metastasis.

>The serial time duration of known survival is terminated by the event of interest; this is known as an interval in Kaplan-Meier analysis and is graphed as a horizontal line (more on this later). In other words, only event occurrences define known survival time intervals. Censored subjects are indicated on the Kaplan-Meier curve as tick marks; these do not terminate the interval.
