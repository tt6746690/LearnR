[_LOXL2 induces aberrant acinar morphogenesis via ErbB2 signaling_](http://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr3461)  

+ the use of drugs that inhibit ErbB2 to sees gene's effect on MCF10A by incubating antibodies such as Ki-67, activated caspase-3, GM130, E-cadherin, and laminin V. Perhaps do the same with PITPNC1.
+ western blotting on the phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated Erbb2/Akt pathway
+ did inhibition of gene and observed opposite effects  



[_ErbB2, but not ErbB1, reinitiates proliferation and induces luminal repopulation in epithelial acini_](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952547/)  

+ There should be a loss of acinar morphology going from DCIS to IDC? how to explain this.


[Gene Expression Signature in Organized and Growth-Arrested Mammary Acini Predicts Good Outcome in Breast Cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933218/)  

+ Normally, nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) seeded in laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM) form polarized acini and, in doing so, transit from a disorganized proliferating state to an organized growth-arrested state.

Cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions establish mechanistic constraints and a complex biochemical signaling network essential for differentiation and homeostasis of the glandular epithelium.

3D culture models of breast acini show that only cells with disrupted apical polarity can be pushed into the cell cycle. apical polarity loss is the relocation of the cell nucleus away from the basal side, as observed in cells of preinvasive neoplastic stages. Invasive breast tumors in vivo have been characterized by altered expression and localization of BM proteins and receptors

potentially do confocal microscopy with antibodies tagging apical and basal protein

[_Morphogenesis and oncogenesis of MCF-10A mammary epithelial acini grown in three-dimensional basement membrane cultures_](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104620230300032X)  

 Recent studies analyzing the mechanistic basis for phenotypic heterogeneity observed among different oncogenes (e.g., ErbB2, cyclin D1) have illustrated the utility of this three-dimensional culture system in modeling the biological activities of cancer genes, particularly with regard to their ability to disrupt epithelial architecture during the early aspects of carcinoma formation
