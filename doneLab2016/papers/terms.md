[__Haplotype__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype)  
A haplotype is a specific group of genes or alleles that progeny inherited from one parent. Can imply  
+ a collection of specific alleles (that is, specific DNA sequences) in a cluster of tightly-linked genes on a chromosome that are likely to be inherited togetherâ€”that is, they are likely to be conserved as a sequence that survives the descent of many generations of reproduction
+ a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on one chromosome that tend to always occur together. Identifying these statistical associations and few alleles of a specific haplotype sequence can facilitate identifying all other such polymorphic sites that are nearby on the chromosome.
