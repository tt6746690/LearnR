Cancer is an evolutionary process. Somatic mutation accumulates in the process of cancer progression.

Formally defined `Driver` mutations as genes that confer growth advantage on the cells carrying them and have been positively selected during the evolution of the cancer. They reside, by definition, in the subset of genes known as `cancer genes`. The remainder of mutations are `passengers` that do not confer growth advantage, but happened to be present in an ancestor of the cancer cell when it acquired one of its drivers

> A central goal of cancer genome analysis is the identification of cancer genes that, by definition, carry driver mutations. A key challenge will therefore be to distinguish driver from passenger mutations. The main strategy generally used exploits a number of structural signatures associated with mutations that are under positive selection. For example, driver mutations cluster in the subset of genes that are cancer genes whereas passenger mutations are more or less randomly distributed. This has been the approach adopted fruitfully in the past to identify most somatically mutated cancer genes in studies targeted at small regions of the genome.

There has been a great [_progress_](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14993899/) in identifying driver mutations.   
Approximately 90% of the known somatically mutated cancer genes are _dominantly_ acting, that is, mutation of just one allele is sufficient to contribute to cancer development. The other 10% are _recessively_ acting, therefore tumor-suppressing. As a result,  Recessive cancer genes are characterized by diverse mutation types, ranging from single base substitutions to whole gene deletions, which have the common outcome of abolishing the function of the encoded protein. In each dominantly acting cancer gene, however, the repertoire of cancer-causing somatic mutations is usually more constrained, both with respect to the type of mutation and its location in the gene.

Implicit in our discussion was the notion that as normal cells evolve progressively to a neoplastic state, they acquire a succession of these hallmark capabilities, and that the multistep process of human tumor pathogenesis could be rationalized by the need of incipient cancer cells to acquire the traits that enable them to become tumorigenic and ultimately malignant.


_Sustaining proliferative signalling_
+ achieved via
  + produce growth factor ligand and cognate receptors themselves
  + send signals to stimulate normal cells within the tumor-stroma supporting, which reciprocate by providing growth factors
  + deregulation of receptor signalling by either inducing receptor hypersensitivity or ligand-independent signalling  
+ Somatic mutations activate downstream pathways
  + ex. PI3K isoform hyperactivates PI3K/Akt pathway
+ Disruption of negative-feedback that attenuate proliferative signalling
  + ex. Ras oncoprotein does not hyperactivate signalling, but instead compromise RAS GTPase activity, which ensures that active signalling transmission are transient
  + ex. PTEN phosphatase (tumor suppressor), which counteracts PI3-kinase by degrading its product, PIP3. Loss-of-function mutations in PTEN amplify PI3K signaling and promote tumorigenesis
  + ex.  mTOR kinase lies both upstream and downstream of the PI3K pathway. In the circuitry of some cancer cells, mTOR activation results, via negative feedback, in the inhibition of PI3K signaling. Thus, when mTOR is pharmacologically inhibited in such cancer cells (such as by the drug rapamycin), the associated loss of negative feedback results in increased activity of PI3K and its effector Akt/PKB, thereby blunting the antiproliferative effects of mTOR inhibition
+ Excessive Proliferative Signaling Can Trigger Cell Senescence
  + More recent research has undermined this notion, in that excessively elevated signaling by oncoproteins such as RAS, MYC, and RAF can provoke counteracting responses from cells, specifically induction of cell senescence and/or apoptosis

_Evading Growth Suppressors_

+ The two prototypical tumor suppressors encode the RB (retinoblastoma-associated) and TP53 proteins; they operate as central control nodes within two key complementary cellular regulatory circuits that govern the decisions of cells to proliferate or, alternatively, activate senescence and apoptotic programs.
  + The RB protein integrates signals from diverse extracellular and intracellular sources and, in response, decides whether or not a cell should proceed through its growth-and-division cycle

Very similar to what we would be doing.
