abstract = {SUMMARY In clinical measurement comparison of a new measurement technique with an established one is often needed to see whether they agree sufficiently for the new to replace the old. Such investigations are often analysed inappropriately, notably by using correlation coefficients. The use of correlation is misleading. An alternative approach, based on graphical techniques and simple calculations, is described, together with the relation between this analysis and the assessment of repeatability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gene expression profiling of breast cancer has identified two biologically distinct estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A and luminal B. Luminal B tumors have higher proliferation and poorer prognosis than luminal A tumors. In this study, we developed a clinically practical immunohistochemistry assay to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors and investigated its ability to separate tumors according to breast cancer recurrence-free and disease-specific survival. METHODS Tumors from a cohort of 357 patients with invasive breast carcinomas were subtyped by gene expression profile. Hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and the Ki67 index (percentage of Ki67-positive cancer nuclei) were determined immunohistochemically. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the Ki67 cut point to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors. The prognostic value of the immunohistochemical assignment for breast cancer recurrence-free and disease-specific survival was investigated with an independent tissue microarray series of 4046 breast cancers by use of Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression. RESULTS Gene expression profiling classified 101 (28{\%}) of the 357 tumors as luminal A and 69 (19{\%}) as luminal B. The best Ki67 index cut point to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors was 13.25{\%}. In an independent cohort of 4046 patients with breast cancer, 2847 had hormone receptor-positive tumors. When HER2 immunohistochemistry and the Ki67 index were used to subtype these 2847 tumors, we classified 1530 (59{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 57{\%} to 61{\%}) as luminal A, 846 (33{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 31{\%} to 34{\%}) as luminal B, and 222 (9{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 7{\%} to 10{\%}) as luminal-HER2 positive. Luminal B and luminal-HER2-positive breast cancers were statistically significantly associated with poor breast cancer recurrence-free and disease-specific survival in all adjuvant systemic treatment categories. Of particular relevance are women who received tamoxifen as their sole adjuvant systemic therapy, among whom the 10-year breast cancer-specific survival was 79{\%} (95{\%} CI = 76{\%} to 83{\%}) for luminal A, 64{\%} (95{\%} CI = 59{\%} to 70{\%}) for luminal B, and 57{\%} (95{\%} CI = 47{\%} to 69{\%}) for luminal-HER2 subtypes. CONCLUSION Expression of ER, progesterone receptor, and HER2 proteins and the Ki67 index appear to distinguish luminal A from luminal B breast cancer subtypes.},

@article{Coates2015,
abstract = {The 14th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2015) reviewed substantial new evidence on locoregional and systemic therapies for early breast cancer. Further experience has supported the adequacy of tumor margins defined as 'no ink on invasive tumor or DCIS' and the safety of omitting axillary dissection in specific cohorts. Radiotherapy trials support irradiation of regional nodes in node-positive disease. Considering subdivisions within luminal disease, the Panel was more concerned with indications for the use of specific therapies, rather than surrogate identification of intrinsic subtypes as measured by multiparameter molecular tests. For the treatment of HER2-positive disease in patients with node-negative cancers up to 1 cm, the Panel endorsed a simplified regimen comprising paclitaxel and trastuzumab without anthracycline as adjuvant therapy. For premenopausal patients with endocrine responsive disease, the Panel endorsed the role of ovarian function suppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane for patients at higher risk. The Panel noted the value of an LHRH agonist given during chemotherapy for premenopausal women with ER-negative disease in protecting against premature ovarian failure and preserving fertility. The Panel noted increasing evidence for the prognostic value of commonly used multiparameter molecular markers, some of which also carried prognostic information for late relapse. The Panel noted that the results of such tests, where available, were frequently used to assist decisions about the inclusion of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with luminal disease, but noted that threshold values had not been established for this purpose for any of these tests. Multiparameter molecular assays are expensive and therefore unavailable in much of the world. The majority of new breast cancer cases and breast cancer deaths now occur in less developed regions of the world. In these areas, less expensive pathology tests may provide valuable information. The Panel recommendations on treatment are not intended to apply to all patients, but rather to establish norms appropriate for the majority. Again, economic considerations may require that less expensive and only marginally less effective therapies may be necessary in less resourced areas. Panel recommendations do not imply unanimous agreement among Panel members. Indeed, very few of the 200 questions received 100{\%} agreement from the Panel. In the text below, wording is intended to convey the strength of Panel support for each recommendation, while details of Panel voting on each question are available in supplementary Appendix S2, available at Annals of Oncology online.},

@article{Cuzick2011,
abstract = {PURPOSE We recently reported that the mRNA-based, 21-gene Genomic Health recurrence score (GHI-RS) provided additional prognostic information regarding distant recurrence beyond that obtained from classical clinicopathologic factors (age, nodal status, tumor size, grade, endocrine treatment) in women with early breast cancer, confirming earlier reports. The aim of this article is to determine how much of this information is contained in standard immunohistochemical (IHC) markers. PATIENTS AND METHODS The primary cohort comprised 1,125 estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) patients from the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, had the GHI-RS computed, and had adequate tissue for the four IHC measurements: ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67. Distant recurrence was the primary end point, and proportional hazards models were used with sample splitting to control for overfitting. A prognostic model that used classical variables and the four IHC markers (IHC4 score) was created and assessed in a separate cohort of 786 patients. RESULTS All four IHC markers provided independent prognostic information in the presence of classical variables. In sample-splitting analyses, the information in the IHC4 score was found to be similar to that in the GHI-RS, and little additional prognostic value was seen in the combined use of both scores. The prognostic value of the IHC4 score was further validated in the second separate cohort. CONCLUSION This study suggests that the amount of prognostic information contained in four widely performed IHC assays is similar to that in the GHI-RS. Additional studies are needed to determine the general applicability of the IHC4 score.},

abstract = {The Ki-67 antigen is used to evaluate the proliferative activity of breast cancer (BC); however, Ki-67's role as a prognostic marker in BC is still undefined. In order to better define the prognostic value of Ki-67/MIB-1, we performed a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the impact of Ki-67/MIB-1 on disease-free survival (DFS) and/or on overall survival (OS) in early BC. Sixty-eight studies were identified and 46 studies including 12 155 patients were evaluable for our meta-analysis; 38 studies were evaluable for the aggregation of results for DFS, and 35 studies for OS. Patients were considered to present positive tumours for the expression of Ki-67/MIB-1 according to the cut-off points defined by the authors. Ki-67/MIB-1 positivity is associated with higher probability of relapse in all patients (HR=1.93 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.74-2.14); P{\textless}0.001), in node-negative patients (HR=2.31 (95{\%} CI: 1.83-2.92); P{\textless}0.001) and in node-positive patients (HR=1.59 (95{\%} CI: 1.35-1.87); P{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, Ki-67/MIB-1 positivity is associated with worse survival in all patients (HR=1.95 (95{\%} CI: 1.70-2.24; P{\textless}0.001)), node-negative patients (HR=2.54 (95{\%} CI: 1.65-3.91); P{\textless}0.001) and node-positive patients (HR=2.33 (95{\%} CI: 1.83-2.95); P{\textless}0.001). Our meta-analysis suggests that Ki-67/MIB-1 positivity confers a higher risk of relapse and a worse survival in patients with early BC.},

abstract = {The pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a surrogate marker for a favorable prognosis in breast cancer patients. Factors capable of predicting a pCR, such as the proliferation marker Ki67, may therefore help improve our understanding of the drug response and its effect on the prognosis. This study investigated the predictive and prognostic value of Ki67 in patients with invasive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Ki67 was stained routinely from core biopsies in 552 patients directly after the fixation and embedding process. HER2/neu, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and grading were also assessed before treatment. These data were used to construct univariate and multivariate models for predicting pCR and prognosis. The tumors were also classified by molecular phenotype to identify subgroups in which predicting pCR and prognosis with Ki67 might be feasible. Using a cut-off value of {\textgreater} 13{\%} positively stained cancer cells, Ki67 was found to be an independent predictor for pCR (OR 3.5; 95{\%} CI, 1.4, 10.1) and for overall survival (HR 8.1; 95{\%} CI, 3.3 to 20.4) and distant disease-free survival (HR 3.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.8 to 5.9). The mean Ki67 value was 50.6 ± 23.4{\%} in patients with pCR. Patients without a pCR had an average of 26.7 ± 22.9{\%} positively stained cancer cells. Ki67 has predictive and prognostic value and is a feasible marker for clinical practice. It independently improved the prediction of treatment response and prognosis in a group of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. As mean Ki67 values in patients with a pCR were very high, cut-off values in a high range above which the prognosis may be better than in patients with lower Ki67 values may be hypothesized. Larger studies will be needed in order to investigate these findings further.},

Methods Between December 1992 and June 2000, 769 women with early breast cancer (tumor diameter, 5 cm or less) were randomly assigned to receive breast irradiation plus tamoxifen (386 women) or tamoxifen alone (383 women). The median follow-up was 5.6 years. Results The rate of local relapse at five years was 7.7 percent in the tamoxifen group and 0.6 percent in the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation (hazard ratio, 8.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.3 to 21.2; P{\textless}0.001), with corresponding five-year disease-free survival rates of 84 percent and 91 percent (P=0.004).

abstract = {AIMS The proliferation factor Ki67 is prognostic in breast cancer and included in international therapy guidelines, but measurement procedures differ between laboratories. We compared the reproducibility and prognostic value of different Ki67 sampling and measurement methods. METHODS AND RESULTS In 237 T(1,2) N(0) M(0) breast cancers without adjuvant systemic treatment, strictly standardized section thickness, automated antigen retrieval and immunohistochemistry were used. The percentages of Ki67-positive nuclei were assessed using (i) a 'quick-scan rapid estimate', (ii) ocular-square-guided counts by independent pathologists, (iii) computerized point-grid-sampling interactive morphometry (CIM) and (iv) automated digital image analysis (DIA). Quick-scan rapid estimates were poorly reproducible. The optimal prognostic thresholds of Ki67 counts by two pathologists differed greatly (4{\%}, 14{\%}; kappa: 0.36), with many therapeutic differences. CIM-Ki67 and DIA-Ki67 were strongly prognostic (P{\textless}0.0001) and reproducible. DIA-Ki67 (threshold: 6.5{\%}) was the strongest and most robust prognosticator (the threshold could vary from 4 to 15{\%} without significant prognostic loss). Ki67 was prognostically strongest in the periphery of the tumour. CONCLUSION In node-negative breast cancer without adjuvant systemic treatment, Ki67{\%} by DIA, but not subjective counts, is reproducible and prognostically strong. This casts serious doubt on therapeutic guidelines using subjective counts of Ki67.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To update the recommendations for the use of tumor marker tests in the prevention, screening, treatment, and surveillance of breast cancer. METHODS For the 2007 update, an Update Committee composed of members from the full Panel was formed to complete the review and analysis of data published since 1999. Computerized literature searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The Update Committee's literature review focused attention on available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published tumor marker studies. In general, significant health outcomes (overall survival, disease-free survival, quality of life, lesser toxicity, and cost-effectiveness) were used for making recommendations. Recommendations and CONCLUSIONS Thirteen categories of breast tumor markers were considered, six of which were new for the guideline. The following categories showed evidence of clinical utility and were recommended for use in practice: CA 15-3, CA 27.29, carcinoembryonic antigen, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, urokinase plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and certain multiparameter gene expression assays. Not all applications for these markers were supported, however. The following categories demonstrated insufficient evidence to support routine use in clinical practice: DNA/ploidy by flow cytometry, p53, cathepsin D, cyclin E, proteomics, certain multiparameter assays, detection of bone marrow micrometastases, and circulating tumor cells.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Immunohistochemical Ki67 labelling index (Ki67 LI) reflects proliferative activity and is a potential prognostic/predictive marker of breast cancer. However, its clinical utility is hindered by the lack of standardized measurement methodologies. Besides tissue heterogeneity aspects, the key element of methodology remains accurate estimation of Ki67-stained/counterstained tumour cell profiles. We aimed to develop a methodology to ensure and improve accuracy of the digital image analysis (DIA) approach. METHODS Tissue microarrays (one 1-mm spot per patient, n = 164) from invasive ductal breast carcinoma were stained for Ki67 and scanned. Criterion standard (Ki67-Count) was obtained by counting positive and negative tumour cell profiles using a stereology grid overlaid on a spot image. DIA was performed with Aperio Genie/Nuclear algorithms. A bias was estimated by ANOVA, correlation and regression analyses. Calibration steps of the DIA by adjusting the algorithm settings were performed: first, by subjective DIA quality assessment (DIA-1), and second, to compensate the bias established (DIA-2). Visual estimate (Ki67-VE) on the same images was performed by five pathologists independently. RESULTS ANOVA revealed significant underestimation bias (P {\textless} 0.05) for DIA-0, DIA-1 and two pathologists' VE, while DIA-2, VE-median and three other VEs were within the same range. Regression analyses revealed best accuracy for the DIA-2 (R-square = 0.90) exceeding that of VE-median, individual VEs and other DIA settings. Bidirectional bias for the DIA-2 with overestimation at low, and underestimation at high ends of the scale was detected. Measurement error correction by inverse regression was applied to improve DIA-2-based prediction of the Ki67-Count, in particularfor the clinically relevant interval of Ki67-Count {\textless} 40{\%}. Potential clinical impact of the prediction was tested by dichotomising the cases at the cut-off values of 10, 15, and 20{\%}. Misclassification rate of 5-7{\%} was achieved, compared to that of 11-18{\%} for the VE-median-based prediction. CONCLUSIONS Our experiments provide methodology to achieve accurate Ki67-LI estimation by DIA, based on proper validation, calibration, and measurement error correction procedures, guided by quantified bias from reference values obtained by stereology grid count. This basic validation step is an important prerequisite for high-throughput automated DIA applications to investigate tissue heterogeneity and clinical utility aspects of Ki67 and other immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers.},

There is interest in automating the assessment of Ki-67 labelling index (LI) with possible benefits in handling increased workload, with improved accuracy and precision. PATIENTS AND METHODS Visual and automated assessment of Ki-67 LI and survival were examined in patients with primary operable invasive ductal breast cancer. Tissue microarrays (n=379 patients) immunostained for Ki-67 were scored visually and automatically with the Slidepath Tissue IA system. RESULTS Visual and automated Ki-67 LI were in excellent agreement (ICCC=0.96, P{\textless}0.001). On univariate analysis, visual (P{\textless}0.001) and automated Ki67 LI (P{\textless}0.05) were associated with cancer-specific survival in patients with invasive ductal breast cancer overall and in patients who received endocrine therapy (Tamoxifen) (P{\textless}0.01 for visual and P{\textless}0.05 for automated scoring). CONCLUSION Automated assessment of Ki-67 LI would appear to be comparable to visual Ki-67 LI. However, automated Ki-67 LI assessment was inferior in predicting cancer survival in patients with breast cancer, including patients who received Tamoxifen.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In breast cancer, immunohistochemical assessment of proliferation using the marker Ki67 has potential use in both research and clinical management. However, lack of consistency across laboratories has limited Ki67's value. A working group was assembled to devise a strategy to harmonize Ki67 analysis and increase scoring concordance. Toward that goal, we conducted a Ki67 reproducibility study. METHODS Eight laboratories received 100 breast cancer cases arranged into 1-mm core tissue microarrays-one set stained by the participating laboratory and one set stained by the central laboratory, both using antibody MIB-1. Each laboratory scored Ki67 as percentage of positively stained invasive tumor cells using its own method. Six laboratories repeated scoring of 50 locally stained cases on 3 different days. Sources of variation were analyzed using random effects models with log2-transformed measurements. Reproducibility was quantified by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the approximate two-sided 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for the true intraclass correlation coefficients in these experiments were provided. RESULTS Intralaboratory reproducibility was high (ICC = 0.94; 95{\%} CI = 0.93 to 0.97). Interlaboratory reproducibility was only moderate (central staining: ICC = 0.71, 95{\%} CI = 0.47 to 0.78; local staining: ICC = 0.59, 95{\%} CI = 0.37 to 0.68). Geometric mean of Ki67 values for each laboratory across the 100 cases ranged 7.1{\%} to 23.9{\%} with central staining and 6.1{\%} to 30.1{\%} with local staining. Factors contributing to interlaboratory discordance included tumor region selection, counting method, and subjective assessment of staining positivity. Formal counting methods gave more consistent results than visual estimation. CONCLUSIONS Substantial variability in Ki67 scoring was observed among some of the world's most experienced laboratories. Ki67 values and cutoffs for clinical decision-making cannot be transferred between laboratories without standardizing scoring methodology because analytical validity is limited.},

abstract = {AIMS The term 'objective' connotes a method that is based on facts and not influenced by personal opinions, perception or emotion. One often reads in the biomedical literature claims of objectivity for methods that use digital image analysis applied to histology. Since objective assessment of histology would represent a huge leap forward in scientific measurement and clinical diagnosis, such claims should be substantiated by strong evidence. This paper takes a selective look at the literature on image analysis to assess the definition of objectivity in image analysis and asks whether such a claim is ever justified. METHODS First, a brief background on the basic science of image analysis in histology details some of the controversies and opinions in the field. Then, a literature review of a subset of papers pertaining to image analysis in histology (with claims of objectivity) is conducted to determine what evidence exists for objectivity in these methods. RESULTS It was found that image analysis may have many benefits (speed, indefatigability, standardisation, etc.). However, algorithms are devised and implemented by human beings who make subjective decisions at each stage of the algorithm design and implementation process. Thus, image analysis methods can be seen as deterministic processes which 'objectively' implement the subjective decisions of the programmer. This indicates that 'inter-observer' variation in image analysis is equivalent to 'inter-algorithm' variation (which is rarely studied) and that a single computer algorithm's repeatability is of lesser importance than the repeatability of the image analysis method as a whole (including the block, slide and field selection and the method of tissue processing). CONCLUSION Repeatability and automaticity must not be confused with objectivity, but a lack of objectivity does not imply a lack of utility. Unless specific evidence of objectivity is provided, editors should insist that claims of objectivity in image analysis papers be either removed or justified prior to publication.},

@article{Trihia2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The number of mitoses and, thus, the proliferative capacity of a tumor is one of the most crucial variables for tumor grading. The Ki-67 nuclear antigen may be considered as an alternative to mitotic counts in grading schemes and as a single parameter that can be used in fine-needle aspirates and small biopsies. METHODS Immunohistochemistry using the anti-Ki-67 antibody MIB-1 was performed on 434 breast carcinoma specimens from the International Breast Cancer Study Group (formerly Ludwig) Trial V. Three groups based on Ki-67 percent were used to replace the mitotic counts component in the Nottingham grade (NHG) to produce the Nottingham/Ki-67 grade (NKG) and to assess Ki-67 as a single parameter. RESULTS In both the lymph node positive subgroup and the lymph node negative subgroup, the NKG and Ki-67 group was correlated significantly with Bloom-Richardson grade (BRG), NHG, and Nottingham type. Tumor size in the lymph node negative cohort and estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, and c-erbB-2 expression in the lymph node positive cohort also were correlated significantly with NKG. Ki-67 percentage was correlated significantly with c-erbB-2 expression in the lymph node positive cohort only. NKG was similar to BRG and NHG when it was evaluated for prognostic significance. Patients with higher categoric Ki-67 percentages had worse overall and disease free survival in all groups except for the untreated, lymph node negative group. CONCLUSIONS Ki-67 detection represents a valuable tool and is a good objective substitute for mitotic counts when used in a grading system. When it is used alone, Ki-67 detection provides valuable information, although it is necessary to combine this with other parameters in the study of core biopsies and fine-needle aspirates.},

@article{VanDiest2004,
abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among solid tumours in women, and its incidence is increasing in the West. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal treatment improve survival but have potentially serious side effects, and are costly. Because adjuvant treatment should be given to high risk patients only, and traditional prognostic factors (lymph node status, tumour size) are insufficiently accurate, better predictors of high risk and treatment response are needed. Invasive breast cancer metastasises haematogenously very early on, so many breast cancer prognosticators are directly or indirectly related to proliferation. Although studies evaluating the role of individual proliferation regulating genes have greatly increased our knowledge of this complex process, the functional end result-cells dividing-has remained the most important prognostic factor. This article reviews the prognostic value of different proliferation assays in invasive breast cancer, and concludes that increased proliferation correlates strongly with poor prognosis, irrespective of the methodology used. Mitosis counting provides the most reproducible and independent prognostic value, and Ki67/MIB1 labelling and cyclin A index are promising alternatives that need methodological fine tuning.},

@article{Tang2012,
abstract = {Pathologic grading for prognostic stratification of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is critical but presents a challenging interpretive dilemma. Tumor cell proliferative rate is an important factor in the determination of prognosis, and immunohistochemical analysis with Ki67 is becoming more widely used to quantify the proliferative rate. However, Ki67 assessment has limitations due to lack of uniformity and consistency in quantification. These limitations are accentuated in well-differentiated NETs, as differences in the range of 1{\%} to 5{\%} can alter tumor grade, with potential implications for treatment. We therefore performed a concordance study to assess different Ki67 quantification techniques including: (a) digital image analysis (DIA); (b) manual counting (MC) of {\textgreater}2000 cells; and (c) "eyeballed" estimate (EE) of labeling percentage by pathologists (n=18), including individuals experienced in evaluating Ki67 labeling as well as others who had little prior experience assessing Ki67 percentages. Forty-five Ki67 images were selected and analyzed using the 3 methods. On the basis of the recommendations of the World health Organization (WHO) for grading NETs, MC of 2000 cells was used as the "gold standard" reference against which the other techniques were compared. Three images were presented twice, the second being inverted, to assess intraobserver consistency. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate: (a) the concordance between methods; (b) intraobserver and interobserver consistency; and (c) correlation of NET grades on the basis of Ki67 scores by EE versus the gold standard. Agreement between scores was assessed by intraclass correlation (ICC). DIA and MC were highly concordant (ICC=0.98). The ICC between DIA and the mean EE of all observers was 0.88. However, there was discordance among individual observers on all cases quantified by EE (ICC=0.13). The ICC for intraobserver consistency was 0.39±0.26. With Ki67 in the ranges of {\textless}1{\%}, 2{\%} to 3{\%}, and {\textgreater}20{\%}, the mean of Ki67 by EE was, respectively, 93{\%}±2{\%}, 55{\%}±7{\%}, and 55{\%}±15{\%} correct against the gold standard. The $\kappa$ statistics for EE exhibited low agreement ($\kappa$=0.24; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.23-0.25) for all WHO NET grades. Incorrect assessment by EE resulted in upgrading of all WHO G1 group tumors (n=14); in the WHO G2 group, downgrading of 41{\%} cases occurred (n=11) when Ki67 was {\textless}5{\%} (by DIA or MC), and upgrading of 59{\%} cases occurred (n=16) when Ki67 was {\textgreater}5{\%}. We conclude that DIA and MC are the acceptable standards for Ki67 assessment. Given the inherent discordance in determining the grade, the use of an approximate EE of the Ki67-labeling index requires critical reevaluation, especially for NETs with a labeling index straddling the cut-points between grades. Consequently, determination of therapeutic strategies should be guided by an amalgamation of clinicopathologic characteristics, including but not limited to the Ki67 index.},

abstract = {The standardized assessment of Ki67 labeling index (LI) is of clinical importance to identify patients with primary breast cancer who could benefit from chemotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the interobserver concordance of Ki67 LI assessment. Six surgical pathologists participated and all the slides were prepared from archival breast cancer tissues fixed in 10{\%} buffered formalin for 24 h and stained with MIB-1. Three independent studies were conducted. In the first study, 30 stained slides were assessed using two different methods: the scoring system, with a positive rate scored from 1 (0-9{\%}) to 10 (90-100{\%}) by visual estimate; and the counting method, with approximately 1000 cells counted in hot spots. In the second study, 20 tumors with Ki67 LI 5-25{\%} were assessed, and in the third study, 15 printed photographs of stained slides were assessed to avoid variations by selecting different fields. In study 1, the counting system (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.66 [95{\%} confidence interval 0.52-0.78]) demonstrated a better correlation than the scoring system (ICC, 0.57 [0.42-0.72]). In study 2, the assessment for Ki67 LI of 5-25{\%} demonstrated a correlation (ICC, 0.68 [0.50-0.81]) similar to that of study 1 (unrestricted range of Ki67 LI). In study 3, the assessment of Ki67 LI by counting yielded a good concordance (ICC, 0.94 [0.88-0.97]). In conclusion, there was better concordance with the counting system, and concordance was high when the assessed field was predetermined, indicating that the selection of the evaluation area is critical for obtaining reproducible Ki67 LI in breast cancer.},
